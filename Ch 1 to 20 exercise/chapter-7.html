// Chapter 7 (Math Expression III)
//Q No.1. var calculatedNum = 2 + (2 * 6); What is the value of calculatedNum?

//Answer.
calculatedNum = 2 + (2 * 6); //calculatedNum is 14

//Q. No. 2. var calculatedNum = (2 + 2) * 6; What is the value of calculatedNum?

//Answer.
var calculatedNum = (2 + 2) * 6;  //calculatedNum is 24


//Q. No. 3. var calculatedNum = (2 + 2) * (4 + 2); What is the value of calculatedNum?

//Answer.
var calculatedNum = (2 + 2) * (4 + 2);   //calculatedNum is 24


//Q. No. 4. var calculatedNum = ((2 + 2) * 4) + 2; What is the value of calculatedNum?

//Answer.
var calculatedNum = ((2 + 2) * 4) + 2;  //calculatedNum is 18


//Q. No. 5. Write a statement that assigns to cost the result of 2 + 2 * 4 + 10, clarified with parentheses, producing 56.
