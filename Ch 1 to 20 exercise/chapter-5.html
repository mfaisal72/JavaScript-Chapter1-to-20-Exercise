// Chapter 5 (Math Expression I)
//Q No. 1. What is the name and symbol of the arithmetic operator that gives you the remainder when one number is divided by another?
// Answer
// Example of the Modulus operator
var dividend = 10;
var divisor = 3;

var remainder = dividend % divisor;

console.log("The remainder is: " + remainder);


// Q No. 2. What is the value of num?
// var num = 20 % 6;

var num = 20 % 6;
console.log(num); //the num value is 2


// Q. No.3. In a single statement, declare the variable largeNum and assign it the result of 1,000 multiplied by 2,000.
//Answer.
var largeNum = 1000 * 2000;
console.log(largeNum); //the result is 2000000


// Q. No. 4. Assign to a variable the value represented by one variable // subtracted from the value represented by another variable
//Answer.
// Declare and assign values to two variables
var firstNum = 10;
var secondNum = 5;

// Assign the result of subtracting secondNum from firstNum to a third variable
var result = firstNum - secondNum;
console.log(result); //the result is 5


// Q. No. 5. Assign to a variable the remainder when one number is divided by another. The variable hasn't been declared beforehand. Make up the variable name.
//Answer.
// Declare a variable on the fly and assign the remainder
var remainderResult = 15 % 4;
console.log(remainderResult); // the remainderResult is 3


// Q. No. 6. Code an alert that displays the result of a multiplication on 2 numbers.
//Answer.
// Declare and assign values to two numbers
var number1 = 5;
var number2 = 8;

// Calculate the result of the multiplication
var multiplicationResult = number1 * number2;
alert("The result of the multiplication is: " + multiplicationResult); // the result is 40
